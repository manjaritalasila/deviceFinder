# deviceLocater

# This program allows users to map out their homes/apartments to help them find misplaced devices tied to their iCloud account. Find My iPhone can be used to locate devices in general public areas but does not give an exact location within a small area, such as one's home. This program will let you know which room of your house/apartment your device is in.

# To use this program, first run the setUp file to map out your home/apartment and connect to your iCloud accout. After the initial set up, you can run the mainCode file whenever you need to locate a device within your house.
